<h2>Services</h2>
Snell Experts is a United States of America owned and operated nationwide directory of environmental and property restoration specialists. Our corporate office is located in Charlotte, North Carolina. We are seen in most cities throughout the states, and have our website broken down so that people can find proven experts, even in the smallest of locations.

We are more than a digital directory; we are a team of people who have different backgrounds in the industry. We consist of anything from certified Mold inspectors; on over to people that can wire a house from scratch. You can say that being in business over 25 years comes with battle scars. We have certainly paid our dues and have learned a lot over the years. Our goal is take what we know, and find the best possible experts just to pass them on to those searching to get their environmental issues resolved. We only allow proven and highly rated talent to assist those searching for help.

To get a better idea of whom we are and how we operate, we have taken time to interview the owner of our company. If you still have more questions about us, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We will gladly answer all of your questions and resolve any concerns!

<b>- Interviewer Question:</b><br>
Why did you create SnellExperts.com?<br>
- Owner Response:<br><br>
The main purpose was to try and get more exposure to the tried and true Mom and Pop companies out there. We are in a financial depression, regardless of what the media says.<br>
I started noticing that many of the experts, who do a great job, were going out of business in droves.<br>

<div>
I also wanted to either find a platform, or build one to get the really talented people in one spot for the customers that my restoration company could not assist, due to location. The goal was to be able to help others find a company like mine, so that I know they are getting the best possible care. I hate that many times my company cannot be in 20 places at one time, so SnellExperts.com fixes that.
