        <h3><span class="blue">The Honorable Team</span></h3>
        <p>We are an honorable business family. Thinking like a customer, we take integrity to the next level by only allowing honorable companies to be listed on our Directory, no matter how much money is offered to us by the bad guys. It's not all about money here. We run a business, but we have integrity and choose quality companies over tons of people being our website. You may visit some locations and only a couple of companies are in a particular area. That's because we haven't been enlightened of an actual company like ours, which actually respects their customers, tells the truth and cuts out the junk.</p>

        <h3><span class="blue">Exposing The Best</span></h3>
        <p>Snell Experts provides the most researched list of high quality contractors in the environmental industry.  We did our homework before we let just any company be a recommended Expert. We spend lots of time to assure satisfaction and ease for the people that come to our website who are looking for great contractors, far before they even start researching.  By building a safe zone for people, we can get more customers to great companies, therefore our growth helps grow the people that deserve to be seen.</p>

        <h3><span class="blue">Experienced Recruitment</span></h3>
        <p>Snell Experts searches through every crevasse, nook and cranny to find the best possible companies for our visitors. We put in countless hours asking around through our networks, checking reviews sites like the Better Business Bureau and sometimes just start calling people to see who the best companies and contractors are, in their local areas. Our research of applicants to be on Snell Experts is tedious, as we complete deep background research from checking out customer feedback, on over verifying certifications.  In short, we take the drama and the guess work out of finding an Environmental Expert.</p>

                <span>The main purpose was to try and get more exposure to the tried and true Mom and Pop companies out there. We are in a financial depression, regardless of what the media says. 
I started noticing that many of the experts, who do a great job, were going out of business in droves.
I also wanted to either find a platform, or build one to get the really talented people in one spot for the customers that my restoration company could not assist, due to location. The goal was to be able to help others find a company like mine, so that I know they are getting the best possible care. I hate that many times my company cannot be in 20 places at one time, so SnellExperts.com fixes that.</span>

We do allow other types of “Sponsors” in our directory. These sponsors can only appear in a few places on our website, and they do not have to be in our restoration services categories.</span>

                <span>I started out with carpet and furniture cleaning in 1987. I love cleanliness! It’s the next best thing to godliness to me. I then shifted over to Mold inspection, Mold removal, fire damage repair, crime scene cleanup, water extraction, and water damage repair. It felt natural to me that I should cleanup all of the mess, not just what’s on the carpets.</span>

                <span>As stated before, I started in 1987 doing carpets, but soon shifted over to more advanced fields of cleanup. I own Executive Restoration, LLC, which is a local company to Charlotte, NC. I have had the pleasure of assisting customers through my company for a long time now, but thanks to Snell Experts, I also have the opportunity to help other specialists, and companies within my industry find new customers.</span>

                <span>Well, I guess I will first start with the normal rates, then go into our assistance with companies. The normal rate for us to help companies get exposure is $95 per month, per city that they are in. We have a promo at the time of this interview that if they choose 5 cities, they get each city for only $20 per month, per city. This is for a minimum of a year service from us, as we don’t do month to month service due to the amount of work that goes into helping specialists, and companies find customers.
With that said, we do offer other ways to be on the directory that requires no money at all. What we usually do for people that are struggling, is to offer a trade of service, or trade of product credit. They can give us some labor credits so that we can help customers that really need a discount, or we they can give us products, at same value. Again, most of the time these service, or product credits are given to the customers that have no way of paying a restoration company to help resolve urgent matters.
Another way of getting on here for free is to recommend other people to our directory. If you get us 5 qualified specialists, or companies that fit our criteria, we will give you exposure for free. It’s painless for those who work with people in other fields. An example would be that a tree specialist knows lots of people in landscaping, roof damage repair, and water damage repair. He can recommend his friends, and now can get our premium exposure without charge.</span>
